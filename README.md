## "A node.js toolbox for WebRTC application development"

See: http://www.annodex.org/events/lca2014_mmm/pmwiki.php/Main/Timetable#silvia

## Abstract

WebRTC is enabling a revolution of web-based communications, but it can be tricky to get started. We've developed a toolbox of modules to enable Web application developers to make use of peer-to-peer audio, video or data functionalities. The modules can be used as JavaScript libraries, but are easiest deployed using node.js. See https://www.rtc.io/ for more information.

In the spirit of WebRTC this presentation will be given remotely.
